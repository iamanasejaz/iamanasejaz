Iâ€™m always ready for an adventure, whether itâ€™s trying a new hobby or discovering interesting facts.
Animals are my friends, and I enjoy spending time with pets or observing natureâ€™s creatures.
I always find joy in spending time outdoors, feeling the breeze on my face.
I love drawing and colouring to express my imagination.
Reading animal books is one of my favourite activities.
I like painting and playing.
I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.
Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there. They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a very confident person and know how to talk. I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people.
In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I am the captain of my class football team. I am the best football player at my school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am in expert swimming.
