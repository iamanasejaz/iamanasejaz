- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iamanasejaz.
I Am from Fsd.
I do my F.S.C from Army public College.
i'm student of software engineering.
flutter developer.
web developer.
digital marketing.
andriod developer.
shopify.
CEO.
Iâ€™m always ready for an adventure, whether itâ€™s trying a new hobby or discovering interesting facts.
Animals are my friends, and I enjoy spending time with pets or observing natureâ€™s creatures.
I always find joy in spending time outdoors, feeling the breeze on my face.
I love drawing and colouring to express my imagination.
Reading animal books is one of my favourite activities.
I like painting and playing.
I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news.
Along with this, I fond of reading a few children magazines in which different motivational stories are there. They taught me a high moral lesson. I am a very confident person and know how to talk. I always try to speak to every person according to his requirement so I understand people.
In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I am the captain of my class football team. I am the best football player at my school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am in expert swimming.
I am a good student, who actively participates in all activities, be it exams or extra curricular activities. The extracurricular activities like sports, quiz competitions, essays and speech competitions etc. are the heart of my institution. I myself am essay competition winner on various times.
A man without a sound career planning is like a ship without the radar. It drifts and ultimately sinks down in the deep ocean. But unlike my father, who is a doctor, I myself feel a little interest in this profession. Though it is the best profession but oneâ€™s interest and aptitude differs. I myself wants to be a Civil servant to serve my people in my best capacity.
In that way, I dislike myself being called as a man without a vision and castle maker in sky. I do work for what I dream. So far, I have proved myself being the best one in all fields like in academic, extracurricular and in personal domains. All of this success, hard work, dedication, determination is truly credited to my parents who have made this possible for me.
Successes and failures are closely associated with oneâ€™s achievements and losses. One who achieves anything today has lost a thing yesterday. There is no completely successful man without the mixture of both failures and successes. That is to say, I failed a dozen of times. But, every failure made me stronger ever.
